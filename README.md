# Spam-Classifier
Built a spam classifier from the UCI Spambase data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase.

Used the pre-processed data available in this dataset to build and test Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. All data and code is included in the jupyter notebook available in this repository.
